  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>The Thinkful program is my first introduction into web development. Once I got into the lesson thats when I got really excited and could not wait to apply all things I learned into my own work.</p>

<p>I'm really excited to get into this field because I have heard good things about the atmosphere when working with others and I fit in perfect with that.</p>
